cola - Cache Oblivious Lookahead Array
Copyright (c) 2013 Gianni Tedesco

0. INTRODUCTION
This implements the COLA structure described in the paper
"Cache Oblivious Streaming B-Trees" by Bender, Farach-Colton, et al.

The code implements fractional cascading, keeps growth factor to 2,
and the only other optimisation is a bit of mmap.

Values are not stored yet.

Deamortisation (via background write thread) is also not implemented.
